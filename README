A generic OSC based prompt for inspecting and manipulating clients.

Prompt accepts:
 - TAB
 - disconnect
 - quit
 - exit
 - connect 'port number'
 - general OSC messages sent to the client

It assumes that the client will respond to /path-search:ss for tab completion
and field information.

This is currently Beta software and as such expect some interesting behavior
from time to time.
Discussion and bug reports are appreciated.
